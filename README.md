# roster

This is my submission for the Roster challenge proposed by Timothy Thomas for a job application. To execute the commands, invoke tasks have been made for your convenience. To generate documentation for the project, run invoke gen-docs and open index.html inside the generated _build directory

## python setup

For your convenience, scripts for setting up a Python virtual environment are provided. You must have python installed to use these scripts.

### MacOS and Unix

To setup a Python 2.7 environment on MacOS or linux use the ``setup.sh`` script.

```bash
hostname:username$ sh setup.sh
```

For a Python 3 environment, use the ``setup3.sh`` script. Note that the ``openpyxl`` dependency requires Python >= 3.5.

### Windows

To setup a Python 2.7 environment on Windows use the ``setup.bat`` script.

```batch
C:\Users\username\Documents\roster> setup.bat
```

For a Python 3 environment, use the ``setup3.bat`` script. Note that the ``openpyxl`` dependency requires Python >= 3.5.
